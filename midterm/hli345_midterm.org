*Consider /The Bacchae/ and /Dr. Faustus/ together. Though these two plays are from two very different cultures and eras, what do they say about manâ€™s place in the cosmos? How equipped is humanity in grappling with forces it does not fully understand? Are there any significant similarities between Mephistopheles and Dionysus?*
----------

Despite the large cultural and temporal gap between the authoring of these two pieces, /The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus/ and /The Bacchae/ have more to share than initially meets the eye. Both works involve the clash of man and deity. Both works demonstrate the wrath of god in response to some fatal character flaw of man. In /The Bacchae/ we are introduced to one of the classic fundamental truths of Greek theatre: that fate trumps opportunity. This same "truth" is also exemplified in /Doctor Faustus/, despite it being penned around two thousand years later. Both tales show a human protagonist that is presented with opportunities to repent or submit to the power and decree of the opposing deity, but despite the opportunity, we see them pursue their fate instead. Though one would be hard-pressed to find parallels between the lives of Marlowe and Euripides, their works make similar statements about what happens when man oversteps his bounds.

One of the foremost presentations of this notion appears in /The Bacchae/, when Teiresias offers to Pentheus: "Do not be so certain that power is what matters in the life of man; do not mistake for wisdom the fantasies of your sick mind" (332). Pentheus pursues royal, absolute power and the defense of his nation, Thebes. Teiresias represents a voice of reason, and his purpose is to reconcile what is rational with what is morally correct. Thus, even though Pentheus is presented with the opportunity to heed the words of his advisor, he turns him away and declares him senile. Similarly, in /Doctor Faustus/, we see the Good Angel protest his venture from the very beginning, telling him: "lay that damned book aside and gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul and heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head" (72). In these two instances, we see that despite the massive difference in cultural and temporal context, the two tales use the same literary tools to demonstrate the fatal flaw of their respective protagonists. We see that even though they have the resources and presences in their lives to guide them toward salvation, they pursue their fate to their demise.

Since, in both pieces, we can see a combat between man and a deity, we are able to learn a what the authors believed about man's place in this world. In /The Bacchae/, Pentheus becomes prideful. He tried to stamp out the worship of Dionysus because he felt that his sense of cultural superiority was being attacked; he was threatened by the possibility of disorder in his nation and gets panicked. His stubbornness yields his death, and we are able to see what fee is demanded from those that challenge a deity and overstep their place. The play does exemplify a tolerable, beneficial Dionysian worship, on the part of the messengers. However, rather than allowing this breed of moderate worship, he lets his intimidation take over and suffers as a result. We can see Pentheus suffer from the same problem as Doctor Faustus does: "You do not know the limits of your strength. You do not know what you do. You do not know who you are" (542). In the absolute and unyielding pursuit of excess, Pentheus commits the ultimate sin; he lacks self-awareness. This same theme persists throughout the entirety of the play: "A man, a man, and nothing more, yet he presumed to wage a war with god" (672). Doctor Faustus, in his relentless conceit, foregoes logic and medicine and science to sell his soul to Lucifer in the pursuit of power. In the same way that Pentheus does, Faustus rejects the superiority of the deity, and in trying to become more than what the bounds of man constrained him to, met his doom. He failed to heed those ever-important words: "yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man" (23). Both Marlowe and Euripides challenged contemporary views and interpretations of religion in their work, but at the same time, used religion to emphasize the dangers of pridefulness and the benefits of humility.

Another line of similarity that can be drawn between the two works is that between /The Bacchae/'s Dionysus and /Doctor Faustus/'s Mephistopheles. These are the representatives of divine power for their respective playwrights, and they wield that power without mercy. Both characters start with trickery: Dionysus allows himself to get captured by Pentheus, and Mephistopheles surrenders to Faustus' requests to dress as a friar. They both use this trickery to make it seem like the antagonistic man has the upper hand, or is in a position of power. This feeds their fatal flaw just enough to begin their descent toward their inevitable failure. In /The Bacchae/, we observe the following exchange between Dionysus and Pentheus (509):
    | /P/ | Tell me the benefits that those who know your mysteries enjoy. |
    | /D/ | I am forbidden to say. But they are worth knowing.             |
    | /P/ | Your answers are designed to make me curious.                  |
    | /D/ | No: our mysteries abhor an unbelieving man.                    |
Just as Mephistopheles skirts his "master's" requests for knowledge and power, Dionysus does not allow Pentheus to glean information about his cult or his mysteries. Once their respective human opponents got a taste of power, they were denied any further requests, but by then, their fates were already sealed. Mephistopheles later squashes Faustus' eventual attempt to repent, bullying him into subjection with threats of violence for trying to go back on his agreement with his true master, Lucifer. In the same way that Dionysus uses Pentheus' own mother against him, we see the true ruthlessness of divinity when challenged by man, and we see how effectively Marlowe and Euripides were able to use the divine as a tool to highlight the tragic flaws of man.

Hence, though it seems preposterous to draw such strong connections between works so dissimilar in the environmental context in which they were authored, we can see that they do in fact exist. Euripides and Christopher Marlowe use the same literary tools to convey the same tragic flaws in man: a lack of self-awareness and a lack of restraint to the bounds to which we should be confined. We see that in the blind pursuit of pride and power, despite being presented with words of caution and opportunities to repent, man will suffer at the hand of beings more powerful. As presented in /The Bacchae/ so eloquently, "humility is wise; humility is blest" (1054).
