/Character is fate, fate is character./
Ex: Choose between Pierce and Arthur's. 

There is choice, but it doesn't matter because of fate; fate trumps opportunity.

- Athens was a paradox, in that it was a democracy.

* Women
- Women had no power, could not vote
- Two Bacchaes:
  - *Inside the city:* Dionysus's willing followers, came to worship him of their own volition
  - *Outside the city:* Under an enchantment, not willing followers

* Worship and Devotion
As much about religious ritual and tradition as anything else.
** Theatre is part of religious devotion.
   - Sacrifice is built in to going to the theatre to participate in these plays.
