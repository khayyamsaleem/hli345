* Main Idea
- a consummate scholar's embrace of necromancy to gain a "world of profit and delight."
- Dr. Faustus, unsatisfied by Logic and the sciences, sold his soul to the devil for power.
- employed forbidden means to achieve his most extravagant dreams and ambitions
- dared to do more than heavenly power permitted
- play dramatizes how little Faustus receives in return for his investment and how fiercely he strives to repent before the clock runs out and Mephistopheles comes to claim him.
- Wishes to repent at the end, but Mephistopheles bullies him back into submission
  - Believes himself to be beyond forgiveness
- Was his damnation because he was prideful? Or was it the fault of Calvinism?
- Failed to take advantage of "learning's golden gifts."

* Quotes
- "A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit." _(Line 11)_
- "Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man." _(Line 23)_

* Notable Moments
